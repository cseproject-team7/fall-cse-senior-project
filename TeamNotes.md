# Team Notes & Sponsor Collaboration

This document fulfills the requirements for posting rhythmic check-ins and collaboration logs with our team and sponsor.

## 1. Sponsor Collaboration
We have maintained a consistent rhythm of meetings with our idea sponsor to discuss technologies, concepts, and success criteria.

**Sponsor Meeting Log:**
Below is a visual log of our recorded meetings and feedback sessions with the sponsor.

## 2. Internal Team Check-ins
The team meets on an "as required" basis to discuss cadence, barriers, and updates. We record these sessions to ensure no information is lost.

**Meeting Archive:**
Due to file size constraints, we have compiled our internal meeting recordings and hosted them externally.
