# Team Collaboration Practices

This document outlines the cadence, rhythm, ceremonies, and collaborative practices used by the team to ensure project success.

## 1. Cadence and Rhythm

### Meeting Schedule
* **Sponsor Meetings:** Fridays at 5:30 PM.
* **Team Meetings:** Held on an "as required" basis to address immediate needs, blockers, or team work sessions.

### Status Updates
* **Method:** Major updates are posted immediately in the team's Microsoft Teams chat as features are implemented.

## 2. Team Ceremonies
**Format:** All synchronous meetings are held via Microsoft Teams.

**Meeting Goals:**
During our check-ins and sponsor meetings, we focus on:
* **Reflection:** Discussing what went well since the last sync.
* **Issues:** Identifying what did not go according to plan.
* **Solutions:** Brainstorming how to overcome specific barriers.

## 3. Collaboration Tools

| Category | Tool | Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Communication** | Microsoft Teams | Used for real-time chats, video meetings, and quick updates. |
| **Task Management** | Jira Board & Teams| Used initally for tracking tickets, backlogs, and alignment with Project Success Criteria. Later moved to Teams due to simplicity. |
| **Documentation** | GitHub | Central repository for code, documentation, and markdown files. |

## 4. Version Control Strategy

### Branching Policy
* **Feature Branching:** We strictly use feature branches.
* **Protection:** No team member is allowed to push code directly to the `master` branch.

### Code Reviews
* **Pull Requests:** To merge a feature, a Pull Request (PR) must be opened.
* **Approval Rule:** All Pull Requests require at least **one approval** from another teammate before they can be merged.
